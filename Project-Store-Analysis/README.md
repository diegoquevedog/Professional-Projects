# Store Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

## Overview
This repository contains a Tableau packaged workbook (Store_Analysis.twbx) that analyzes store performance across customers, categories, time, and order behavior. The workbook consolidates CSV-based data, SQL queries to manipulate the database and leverages Tableau calculations and federated connections for transformation. You can see the dashboard [Here](https://public.tableau.com/views/Store_Analysis_17583065407420/Story1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
