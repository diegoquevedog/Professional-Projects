# 🏦 Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview

**Comprehensive Bank Loan Portfolio Analysis** — Using Tableau to analyze loan performance, risk assessment, and profitability metrics across different customer segments, geographic regions, and loan characteristics to support data-driven lending decisions and portfolio management.

This project provides actionable insights into loan default patterns, customer segmentation, geographic performance, and revenue optimization for financial institutions.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

**Why this project matters:**
- Identify high-risk loan segments and default patterns to minimize financial losses
- Analyze geographic and demographic trends to optimize lending strategies
- Evaluate loan performance across different customer segments and loan purposes
- Support data-driven decision-making for loan approval processes and risk management
- Provide executive-level insights for portfolio performance and profitability analysis

**Business Impact:**
This analysis enables financial institutions to reduce default rates, optimize interest rate strategies, improve customer segmentation, and enhance overall portfolio profitability through data-driven insights.

## 📈 Dataset

**Data Sources:**
**Primary Dataset**: Multi-dimensional dataset with 40k+ fields covering loan performance customer demographics, loan characteristics, and performance metrics

**Data Processing:**
- Data cleaning and standardization across multiple sources
- Creation of calculated fields for KPIs and performance metrics
- Geographic aggregation for state-level analysis
- Time-series preparation for trend analysis
